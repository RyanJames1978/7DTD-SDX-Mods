This Assembly-CSharp.dll contains all of my patches and is based on a clean copy of A16.4(b8) with no other modifications.
Contains an empty Mods.dll and the required SDX dll's


Installation:

Save a backup of your game folder or create a new folder with a fresh copy of all the game files.
Copy this folder over the top of the folder 7DaysToDie_Data and replace the files as needed.
Start the client with EAC turned off.

Enjoy!
